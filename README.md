# TriangleGenerator
#this generates a triangle based on user input
#This README shouldn't be too long. This project sucked because I had no idea what I was doing half the time.
#Eventually, after hours of researching, I was able to figure out how to get the triangle to print downward.
#Once I figured that out, I messed with my code until I found a way to squish together the ability to print up and down together.
#The final product is code that asks for a user inputted odd number and generates lines of * based on that number.
